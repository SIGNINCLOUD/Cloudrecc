# # desktop-tutorial — Music & Art

A small repository to demonstrate using GitHub Desktop and to share the author's music and art projects.

## Overview

This repository started as a GitHub Desktop tutorial and has grown into a place to showcase music, visual art, and creative notes. It's ideal for sharing tracks, artwork, sketches, and short write-ups about creative process and life experiences.

## Features

- Sections for music and visual art
- Guidance for adding audio tracks, images, and descriptions
- Simple structure so contributors can get started quickly

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/extenxionflow/desktop-tutorial.git

2. Open the repository in GitHub Desktop:
   - File → Add Local Repository → Select the cloned folder

3. Add or update files (for example, add an MP3 or image in the appropriate folder), commit, and push using GitHub Desktop.

## Music

Organize music in a `music/` folder. For each piece, include:
- An audio file (MP3, WAV, or OGG)
- A small markdown file with the same name (e.g., `music/song-title.md`) containing:
  - Title
  - Year
  - Short description or writing about the track
  - Credits and tools used (DAW, instruments, plugins)

Example file structure:
- music/
  - my-song.mp3
  - my-song.md

## Art

Organize visual art in an `art/` folder. For each piece, include:
- An image file (PNG, JPG, or SVG)
- A markdown file with details (e.g., `art/portrait.md`) containing:
  - Title
  - Medium and tools
  - Short artist statement or description
  - Work-in-progress notes (optional)

Example file structure:
